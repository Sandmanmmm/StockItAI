# Workflow Issue Fix - AI_ENRICHMENT Stage Failure

## Issue Identified

**Error Message:**
```
TypeError: itemImages.webScraped is not iterable
    at ImageProcessingService.enhanceImages (imageProcessingService.js:896:23)
```

**Root Cause:**
When we removed AI image generation functionality from the codebase, we didn't properly initialize the `webScraped` property in the `itemImages` object structure. The `enhanceImages()` method on line 773 attempts to spread `itemImages.webScraped` into an array:

```javascript
const allImages = [
  ...itemImages.vendorImages,
  ...itemImages.webScraped,  // ❌ This was undefined/null, causing the error
  ...(itemImages.aiGenerated ? [itemImages.aiGenerated] : [])
]
```

## Fix Applied

**File:** `api/src/lib/imageProcessingService.js`  
**Line:** 568 (in `sourceImagesWithHierarchy` method)

**Before:**
```javascript
const itemImages = {
  lineItemId: item.id,
  productName: item.productName,
  sku: item.sku,
  vendorImages: [],
  googleImages: [],
  referenceBasedAI: [],
  aiGenerated: null,
  recommended: null,
  allOptions: []
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
const itemImages = {
  lineItemId: item.id,
  productName: item.productName,
  sku: item.sku,
  vendorImages: [],
  googleImages: [],
  webScraped: [],  // ✅ Initialize to empty array (for backward compatibility)
  referenceBasedAI: [],
  aiGenerated: null,
  recommended: null,
  allOptions: []
}
```

## Why This Fixes the Issue

1. **Spread Operator Requirements**: The spread operator (`...`) requires an iterable (like an array). When `webScraped` was undefined, JavaScript threw `"not iterable"` error.

2. **Backward Compatibility**: By initializing `webScraped` as an empty array `[]`, the spread operator works correctly even though we're no longer populating this property with web-scraped images.

3. **No Breaking Changes**: This fix doesn't affect any other parts of the codebase. The empty array simply gets spread into `allImages` array without adding any elements.

## Impact

- ✅ **AI_ENRICHMENT stage** can now complete successfully
- ✅ **Image processing pipeline** can execute without errors
- ✅ **Workflow orchestration** progresses through all 9 stages
- ✅ **Product images** can be attached to line items

## Verification Steps

1. Run the test script: `node test-workflow-fix.js`
2. Upload a test PO and verify it reaches `review_needed` status
3. Check that line items have `productImages` arrays populated
4. Confirm Redis Bull queue shows no failed jobs in `ai-enrichment` queue

## Related Files Modified

- `api/src/lib/imageProcessingService.js` - Added `webScraped: []` initialization

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test PO upload completes without errors
- [ ] Workflow reaches AI_ENRICHMENT stage
- [ ] Image processing executes successfully
- [ ] Line items have product images attached
- [ ] No failed jobs in Redis Bull queues
- [ ] PO status becomes `review_needed` (not `failed`)

## Notes

This was a **minor initialization bug** introduced during the AI image generation removal. The fix is **non-breaking** and **backward compatible**. No database migrations or configuration changes are required.
