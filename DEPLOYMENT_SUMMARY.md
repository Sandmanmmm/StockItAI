# Production Fixes Deployed - Summary

**Deployment:** Commit `baf1d18` pushed to main  
**Status:** ✅ Awaiting Vercel deployment  
**Time:** 2025-10-09

## What Was Fixed

### 1. ✅ Const Reassignment Bug
**Location:** `api/src/lib/workflowOrchestrator.js:1259`

**Problem:**
```javascript
const productDrafts = ... // line 1213
// Later...
productDrafts = draftsFromDb // ❌ TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
```

**Solution:**
```javascript
let draftsToProcess = productDrafts // Use let instead
// Later...
draftsToProcess = draftsFromDb // ✅ Works
```

Also removed duplicate database query that was wasting resources.

### 2. ✅ Image Review Table Name Mismatch
**Location:** `api/src/lib/refinementPipelineService.js:753`

**Problem:**
```sql
-- Code tried to query:
SELECT * FROM image_review_options  -- ❌ Doesn't exist

-- But database actually has:
"ImageReviewProductImage"  -- ✅ PascalCase from Prisma
```

**Error:**
```
P2010: Raw query failed. Code: `42P01`. 
Message: `relation "image_review_options" does not exist`
```

**Solution:**
Replaced raw SQL with Prisma query:
```javascript
// Before (raw SQL)
const approvedImages = await db.query(`SELECT...`)

// After (Prisma)
const approvedImages = await prisma.imageReviewProductImage.findMany({
  where: { ... },
  include: { product: true }
})
```

### 3. ✅ Prisma Engine Warmup (Previous Commit)
Already deployed - ensures Prisma client is connected before queries.

## What These Fixes Solve

### Errors That Should Stop:
1. ✅ "Assignment to constant variable" crashes
2. ✅ "relation does not exist" P2010 errors
3. ✅ "Engine is not yet connected" failures
4. ✅ PO workflow stages failing repeatedly
5. ✅ 404 errors on image review API endpoints

### Workflow Should Now Work:
```
Upload PO → Parse → Normalize → Merchant Config → 
AI Enrichment → Create Drafts → Attach Images → 
Create Review Session → Prepare Payload → Sync to Shopify ✅
```

## Monitoring Post-Deploy

### Success Indicators:
- [ ] No P2010 errors in Vercel logs
- [ ] No "Engine is not yet connected" errors
- [ ] No "Assignment to constant" errors
- [ ] PO uploads complete end-to-end
- [ ] Image review sessions created successfully
- [ ] GET /api/image-review/sessions/by-purchase-order/:id returns 200

### Watch For:
- Connection pool timeouts (if still happening, need to optimize queries)
- Google 429 rate limits (need backoff strategy)
- Cron job overload (may need to reduce frequency)

## Verification Steps

Once Vercel deployment completes (~2-3 minutes):

1. **Check Deployment Logs**
   - Ensure build succeeded
   - Verify Prisma client generated correctly

2. **Test PO Upload**
   - Upload a test PO file
   - Monitor logs in Vercel for error patterns
   - Verify workflow progresses through all stages

3. **Check Image Review API**
   - Try accessing image review session by PO ID
   - Should return session data, not 404

## Root Cause Analysis

The database schema was **correct** - tables exist as `ImageReviewProduct`, `ImageReviewProductImage`, etc.

The problem was **legacy code** using wrong table names from an earlier design:
- Old design: snake_case tables (`image_review_items`, `image_review_options`)
- Current reality: PascalCase tables from Prisma (`ImageReviewProduct`, `ImageReviewProductImage`)

The service had already been partially migrated to Prisma, but some methods still used raw SQL with the old table names.

## Next Steps

### Immediate (After Deploy Succeeds):
1. Monitor first few PO uploads closely
2. Check for any new error patterns
3. Verify image review workflow end-to-end

### Short Term:
1. Add rate limiting for Google Image Search (429 errors)
2. Clean up remaining legacy raw SQL methods
3. Optimize connection pooling if timeouts persist
4. Consider reducing cron frequency from 1min to 2-5min

### Long Term:
1. Complete migration to Prisma throughout codebase
2. Remove all raw SQL queries in favor of type-safe Prisma
3. Add integration tests for workflow stages
4. Implement circuit breakers for external APIs
