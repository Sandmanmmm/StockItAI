# 🚀 Deployment Verification: Transaction Abort Fix (60a4f4e)

**Deployment Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Commit:** 60a4f4e  
**Fix:** PostgreSQL transaction abort on unique constraint violation (P2002)

---

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [x] Code committed to GitHub (60a4f4e)
- [x] Code pushed to origin/main
- [x] Vercel redeployment triggered
- [ ] Deployment completed successfully
- [ ] Production logs show new code running

---

## 🔍 Verification Steps

### 1. Confirm Deployment Complete

**Check Vercel Dashboard:**
- Deployment status: ✅ Ready
- Build logs: No errors
- Functions deployed: All serverless functions updated

### 2. Verify New Code Running

**Look for these log patterns in production:**

#### ✅ SUCCESS - New Code Pattern
```
⚠️ PO number XXXXX conflicts - transaction ABORTED by PostgreSQL
🔄 Will resolve conflict OUTSIDE transaction and retry entire operation
```

#### ❌ FAILURE - Old Code Pattern (Should NOT see)
```
⚠️ CONFLICT RESOLUTION INSIDE TRANSACTION - this can be slow!
```

### 3. Test Conflict Resolution

**Trigger a PO number conflict:**
1. Upload same PO multiple times (same PO number extracted)
2. Watch logs for conflict resolution
3. Verify PO created with suffix (e.g., `1142384989090-1`)

**Expected Outcome:**
- ✅ First upload: PO number `1142384989090`
- ✅ Second upload: PO number `1142384989090-1`
- ✅ Third upload: PO number `1142384989090-2`
- ✅ All workflows succeed (no failures)

### 4. Monitor Error Logs

**Watch for these CRITICAL errors (should be ZERO):**

❌ Should NEVER see:
```
Error code: "25P02"
Message: "current transaction is aborted, commands ignored..."
```

✅ Should see:
```
🔄 [CONFLICT RESOLUTION] Found available PO number: XXXXX-1
✅ Created purchase order: XXXXX-1
```

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Immediate (First Hour)
- [ ] Zero "transaction is aborted" errors
- [ ] Conflict resolution happens outside transaction
- [ ] PO number conflicts resolved with suffixes
- [ ] Workflow success rate >95%

### Short Term (First 24 Hours)
- [ ] Zero "25P02" errors in logs
- [ ] All duplicate POs handled gracefully
- [ ] Suffix usage pattern: 1-3 (normal)
- [ ] Timestamp fallbacks <1% of conflicts
- [ ] Overall workflow success rate >99%

### Medium Term (First Week)
- [ ] System stability maintained
- [ ] No regression of previous fixes
- [ ] Performance metrics stable
- [ ] User-reported errors: Zero related to duplicate POs

---

## 🚨 Rollback Criteria

**Immediate rollback if:**
1. **Deployment fails** with build errors
2. **"25P02" errors persist** after deployment (old code still running)
3. **New errors introduced** by the fix
4. **Workflow success rate drops** below 90%

**Rollback Command:**
```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git revert 60a4f4e
git push origin main
```

**Rollback Notes:**
- Previous commit: `d39ba0a` (Progress update timeout fix)
- That commit was stable with all previous fixes working
- Rollback will restore "CONFLICT RESOLUTION INSIDE TRANSACTION" (broken but contained)

## 📈 Monitoring Queries

### Vercel Logs - Search for:

**New Code Confirmation:**
```
"OUTSIDE transaction"
```

**Old Code Detection:**
```
"INSIDE TRANSACTION"
```

**Error Detection:**
```
"25P02"
"transaction is aborted"
```

**Success Confirmation:**
```
"[CONFLICT RESOLUTION] Found available"
"Created purchase order" AND "-1"
```

### Database Queries

**Check for PO number suffixes:**
```sql
SELECT number 
FROM "PurchaseOrder" 
WHERE number LIKE '%-%' 
  AND "createdAt" > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC;
```

**Expected:**
- Multiple POs with same base number + suffixes
- Example: `1142384989090`, `1142384989090-1`, `1142384989090-2`

---

## 🎯 Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Single Upload (No Conflict)
**Action:** Upload PO with unique number  
**Expected:** PO created with original number  
**Success:** ✅ PO created, no conflict resolution triggered

### Scenario 2: Duplicate Upload (First Conflict)
**Action:** Upload same PO twice  
**Expected:** 
- First: `1142384989090`
- Second: `1142384989090-1`  
**Success:** ✅ Both POs created, second has suffix

### Scenario 3: Multiple Duplicates (10+ Conflicts)
**Action:** Upload same PO 12 times  
**Expected:** 
- POs 1-10: Suffixes `-1` through `-10`
- PO 11+: Timestamp fallback (e.g., `1142384989090-1760240060342`)  
**Success:** ✅ All POs created, timestamp used after suffix exhaustion

### Scenario 4: Concurrent Uploads
**Action:** Upload same PO 5 times simultaneously  
**Expected:** All 5 succeed with unique numbers  
**Success:** ✅ No failures, all POs created
