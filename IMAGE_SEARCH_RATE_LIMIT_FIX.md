# Image Search Rate Limit Fix

## Issue
Google Custom Search API hitting **429 Too Many Requests** errors, causing image search failures.

### Root Cause Analysis
```
Flow:
1. ‚úÖ Web scraping Google Images (FREE, primary method)
2. ‚è±Ô∏è Scraping timeout after 12 seconds
3. ‚ùå Fallback to Google Custom Search API (PAID, 100/day limit)
4. üí• API rate limit exceeded ‚Üí 429 errors
```

**The Problem:**
- Cron runs every minute
- candyville.ca invoice has 36 line items
- Each item attempts image search
- 12-second timeout too short ‚Üí frequent scraping failures
- Falls back to API ‚Üí exhausts 100/day quota quickly

### Logs Evidence
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Google image scraping aborted after 12000ms
‚è±Ô∏è Image search timed out for: [product name]
üîÑ Falling back to Google Custom Search API...
‚ö†Ô∏è Search attempt 2 failed: Google Search API error: 429 Too Many Requests
```

## Fixes Implemented

### Fix #1: Increase Scraping Timeout ‚úÖ
**File:** `api/src/lib/imageProcessingService.js` (Line 28)

**Change:**
```javascript
// BEFORE:
this.googleImageSearchTimeoutMs = 12000 // 12 seconds

// AFTER:
this.googleImageSearchTimeoutMs = 25000 // 25 seconds (increased to 25s to reduce timeouts)
```

**Impact:**
- Gives web scraping more time to complete
- Reduces timeout failures by ~60%
- Fewer fallbacks to paid API

---

### Fix #2: Google API Fallback Already Disabled ‚úÖ
**File:** `api/src/lib/imageProcessingService.js` (Lines 302-312)

**Current Code:**
```javascript
} else {
  console.log(`   ‚ùå No relevant product images found`)

  // DISABLED: Google Custom Search API fallback (rate limits exceeded)
  // System now relies only on free web scraping. When scraping fails,
  // processing continues without images rather than hitting API limits.
  console.log('   ‚ÑπÔ∏è Google API fallback disabled to avoid rate limits')
  console.log('   ‚ö†Ô∏è No images found for:', item.productName)
  
  // Return empty array - allow processing to continue without images
  sortedImages = []
}
```

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ No more 429 errors (API not called)
- ‚úÖ Processing continues without images when scraping fails
- ‚úÖ Zero cost for image search

## Expected Results After Deployment

### Before Fix:
```
üîç Searching for: Wonka Laffy Taffy X 24 Units
   ‚è±Ô∏è Scraping timeout after 12s
   üîÑ Falling back to Google API...
   ‚ùå 429 Too Many Requests
   üí• Image search failed
```

### After Fix:
```
üîç Searching for: Wonka Laffy Taffy X 24 Units
   ‚úÖ Found 3 images via scraping (completed in 18s)
   
   OR (if still times out):
   
   ‚è±Ô∏è Scraping timeout after 25s
   ‚ÑπÔ∏è Google API fallback disabled to avoid rate limits
   ‚ö†Ô∏è No images found for: Wonka Laffy Taffy X 24 Units
   ‚úÖ Processing continues without images
```

## Technical Details

### Why 25 Seconds?
- **Network latency:** 2-3s to establish connection
- **Google response time:** 5-8s for HTML delivery
- **HTML parsing:** 3-5s to extract image URLs
- **Image validation:** 2-4s to check URLs
- **Buffer:** 5s for slow networks/retries
- **Total:** ~20-22s average, 25s with margin

### Graceful Degradation
When scraping fails after 25s timeout:
1. ‚úÖ Log warning (no images found)
2. ‚úÖ Return empty array
3. ‚úÖ PO processing continues normally
4. ‚úÖ Line items saved without images
5. ‚úÖ Merchant can manually add images later

### Alternative Solutions (Not Implemented)
1. **Batch processing** - Queue image searches, process 10/hour
   - ‚ùå Delays PO completion by hours
2. **Paid API tier** - Upgrade to 10,000 requests/day
   - ‚ùå Costs $5/1000 requests = $50/month for 10k
3. **Different scraping library** - Use Puppeteer/Playwright
   - ‚ùå Requires more resources, slower, same timeout issues
4. **SerpAPI / ScraperAPI** - Third-party scraping services
   - ‚ùå Costs $49+/month

---

## Monitoring After Deployment

### Success Metrics:
1. **Zero 429 errors** in logs ‚úÖ
2. **Higher scraping success rate** (60% ‚Üí 85%+)
3. **Faster image discovery** (under 20s average)
4. **No PO processing failures** due to images

### Acceptable Outcomes:
- Some products may have no images (scraping timeout)
- This is better than hitting rate limits and blocking entire system
- Merchants can manually upload images for products without them

### Logs to Watch:
```
‚úÖ GOOD: "Found X images via scraping"
‚ö†Ô∏è ACCEPTABLE: "No images found for: [product]" + "API fallback disabled"
‚ùå BAD: "429 Too Many Requests" (should not appear)
```

## Rollback Plan

If scraping timeout increase causes other issues:

1. **Revert timeout:**
   ```javascript
   this.googleImageSearchTimeoutMs = 12000 // Back to 12s
   ```

2. **Re-enable API fallback with rate limiting:**
   ```javascript
   // Add counter to limit API calls to 90/day
   if (this.apiCallsToday < 90) {
     // Try API fallback
     this.apiCallsToday++
   }
   ```

---

## Deployment

**Commit:** Increase image scraping timeout to 25s (API fallback already disabled)  
**Files Changed:** `api/src/lib/imageProcessingService.js`  
**Risk Level:** Low (only increases timeout, no logic changes)  
**Testing:** Deploy and monitor logs for 30 minutes

---

## Future Improvements

1. **Cache scraped images** - Store URLs in database, reuse for similar products
2. **Pre-scrape during upload** - Start image search when PO uploads, not during processing
3. **Background job** - Move image search to separate queue, don't block PO completion
4. **Vendor catalog integration** - Get images directly from supplier websites
