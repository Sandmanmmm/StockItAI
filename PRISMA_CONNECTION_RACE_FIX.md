# Prisma Connection Race Condition Fix

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Commit:** 86e1698  
**Severity:** CRITICAL - Blocking all sequential workflows

## Problem Statement

Sequential workflows were failing with `PrismaClientUnknownRequestError: Engine is not yet connected` errors when multiple workflows were triggered simultaneously by the cron job.

### Error Example
```
Oct 15 12:16:40 - ‚ùå Error stack: PrismaClientUnknownRequestError: 
Invalid `prisma.workflowExecution.findUnique()` invocation: 
Engine is not yet connected. 
Backtrace [{ fn: "start_thread" }, { fn: "__clone" }]
```

### Impact
- **3 workflows** failed at 12:16:39 with same error
- Workflows: `wf_1760544053394_cmgs6h1e`, `wf_1760542400181_cmgs5hls`, `wf_1760541312451_cmgs4uah`
- Blocked testing of sequential workflow feature
- Prevented measuring 3-5 min target completion time

## Root Cause Analysis

### Detailed Investigation

1. **Initial Hypothesis:** Prisma engine not warming up properly
   - ‚ùå INCORRECT - Warmup code at line 483 properly waits 2.5s + verification

2. **Second Hypothesis:** Extension retry logic not catching error
   - ‚ùå INCORRECT - Extension has "Engine is not yet connected" in retryable patterns (line 579)

3. **Final Discovery:** Race condition in concurrent request handling

### The Bug

Located in `api/src/lib/db.js` at lines 195-199 and 207-214:

```javascript
// BEFORE (BUGGY):
if (isConnecting && connectionPromise) {
  console.log(`‚è≥ Another request is connecting, waiting...`)
  await connectionPromise
  console.log(`‚úÖ Connection completed by other request, returning existing client`)
  return prisma  // ‚ùå BUG: Returns global variable, could be stale!
}
```

### How the Race Happens

**Scenario: 3 workflows triggered simultaneously at 12:16:39**

```
Time    Request A                    Request B                    Request C
-----   -------------------------    -------------------------    -------------------------
T+0ms   Call getClient()             Call getClient()             Call getClient()
T+1ms   Start connecting             Wait for connectionPromise   Wait for connectionPromise
T+10ms  Create rawPrisma             (waiting...)                 (waiting...)
T+20ms  await $connect()             (waiting...)                 (waiting...)
T+50ms  Start warmupPromise          (waiting...)                 (waiting...)
T+2500  Wait for warmup...           (waiting...)                 (waiting...)
T+2700  Warmup complete              (waiting...)                 (waiting...)
T+2710  prisma = extendedPrisma      (waiting...)                 (waiting...)
T+2715  return prisma                Wake up, return prisma       Wake up, return prisma
T+2720  Use client ‚úÖ                 Use client ‚ùå STALE!         Use client ‚ùå STALE!
```

**The Problem:**
- Request A properly creates and returns fresh client
- Request B & C wake up after `connectionPromise` completes
- BUT they return the **GLOBAL** `prisma` variable (line 199)
- If the global was null or stale from a previous failed connection, they get a bad client
- The client isn't connected yet ‚Üí "Engine is not yet connected" error

### Why Existing Guards Failed

1. **Warmup Gate (lines 217-221):** 
   ```javascript
   if (prisma && !warmupComplete && warmupPromise && !skipWarmupWait) {
     await warmupPromise
   }
   ```
   - Only triggers if `prisma` is truthy
   - If global `prisma` is null, gate doesn't trigger

2. **Extension Retry Logic (lines 595-640):**
   - Should catch "Engine is not yet connected"
   - BUT error happens BEFORE query enters extension
   - Client validation fails at Prisma core layer

3. **Health Check (lines 246-315):**
   - Only runs on existing clients
   - Not reached during initial connection

## The Solution

### Fix Implementation

**Changed lines 195-199:**
```javascript
// AFTER (FIXED):
if (isConnecting && connectionPromise) {
  console.log(`‚è≥ Another request is connecting, waiting...`)
  const freshClient = await connectionPromise
  console.log(`‚úÖ Connection completed by other request, returning fresh client`)
  // CRITICAL: Return the fresh client from the promise, not the global prisma
  // The global prisma might be stale if there was a previous failed connection
  return freshClient || prisma
}
```

**Changed lines 207-214:**
```javascript
// AFTER (FIXED):
if (isConnecting && connectionPromise) {
  console.log(`‚è≥ Another request is reconnecting, waiting...`)
  const freshClient = await connectionPromise
  console.log(`‚úÖ Reconnection completed by other request`)
  // CRITICAL: Return the fresh client directly, don't recurse
  // Recursing might cause unnecessary health checks or reconnections
  return freshClient || prisma
}
```

### Why This Works

1. **Direct Client Return:** `connectionPromise` resolves to the freshly created client
2. **No Global Dependency:** Doesn't rely on global `prisma` variable being set correctly
3. **Fallback Safety:** `|| prisma` provides fallback if promise returns null
4. **Avoids Recursion:** Second fix eliminates unnecessary recursive `initializePrisma()` call

## Verification Plan

### Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Cold Start (3 concurrent requests):**
   ```
   Request A: Creates client, connects, warms up ‚Üí returns fresh client ‚úÖ
   Request B: Waits for A's promise ‚Üí gets fresh client from promise ‚úÖ
   Request C: Waits for A's promise ‚Üí gets fresh client from promise ‚úÖ
   ```

2. **Warm Instance (subsequent requests):**
   ```
   Request: Existing prisma client ‚Üí health check ‚Üí reuse ‚úÖ
   ```

3. **Reconnection (client aged out):**
   ```
   Request A: Forces disconnect, reconnects ‚Üí returns fresh client ‚úÖ
   Request B: Waits for A ‚Üí gets fresh client from promise ‚úÖ
   ```

### Test Cases

- ‚úÖ Upload single PO ‚Üí should complete all 6 stages
- ‚úÖ Trigger 3 workflows simultaneously ‚Üí all should succeed
- ‚úÖ Monitor logs for "Engine is not yet connected" ‚Üí should not appear
- ‚úÖ Measure completion time ‚Üí target 3-5 minutes
- ‚úÖ Verify merchantId preserved through all stages

## Deployment

**Commit:** 86e1698  
**Deployed:** October 15, 2025 at 12:25 PM EST  
**Vercel Build Time:** ~2-3 minutes  
**Ready for Testing:** ~12:28 PM EST

## Related Issues

- Original issue: "merchantId is not defined" at stage 4
  - Was masked by Prisma connection errors
  - Still need to verify after connection fix
- Debug logging: Commit 4ff27e8
  - Added merchantId tracing before stage 4
  - Will help verify no data loss issues remain

## Next Steps

1. ‚è∏Ô∏è **Wait** for Vercel deployment (2-3 min)
2. üöÄ **Upload** fresh test PO to trigger workflow
3. üëÄ **Monitor** Vercel logs for:
   - No "Engine is not yet connected" errors
   - All 6 stages complete successfully
   - Debug output showing merchantId present
4. ‚è±Ô∏è **Measure** total completion time
5. üìù **Document** results in PHASE_2_TEST_RESULTS.md

## Technical Notes

### Prisma Connection Lifecycle

```
1. new PrismaClient()        ‚Üí Creates client instance
2. await $connect()           ‚Üí Establishes database connection
3. Warmup (2.5s)              ‚Üí Engine startup + verification
4. Two-Phase Verification     ‚Üí Raw SQL + Model operations
5. $extends()                 ‚Üí Add extension middleware
6. Return client              ‚Üí Ready for queries
```

**Total Time:** ~2.7-3.0 seconds on cold start

### Connection Metrics

```javascript
{
  attempts: 3,          // Total connection attempts
  successes: 3,         // Successful connections
  failures: 0,          // Failed connections
  maxConnectionErrors: 0,
  ageRefreshes: 0,
  successRate: "100%"
}
```

### Environment Configuration

- `PRISMA_CONNECTION_LIMIT`: 5 per instance
- `PRISMA_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT`: 10s
- `PRISMA_WARMUP_MS`: 2500ms
- `CONNECTION_MAX_AGE_MS`: 300000ms (5 min)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Module Globals in Serverless:** Be careful with module-scoped variables in serverless - each instance has its own, but they can become stale
2. **Promise Return Values:** Always use the resolved value from promises, don't assume global state is synchronized
3. **Concurrent Cold Starts:** Test with multiple simultaneous requests to catch race conditions
4. **Comprehensive Logging:** Debug logging (commit 4ff27e8) was critical for identifying the issue
5. **Layer Testing:** Bug was in infrastructure layer, not application layer (merchantId tracking was red herring)
