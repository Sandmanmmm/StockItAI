# Vision API Timeout Fix - Implementation Summary

**Date**: October 14, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **DEPLOYED & VERIFIED**

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

**Original Issue**: Workflows were getting stuck at 10% (AI parsing stage) due to Vision API calls timing out after exactly 60 seconds, causing complete workflow failures that required manual intervention.

**Example**:
- Workflow `wf_1760457694989_cmgqr22u` - stuck at ai_parsing 10% with error: "Vision API timed out after 60 seconds"
- Workflow `wf_1760455082501_cmgqpi30` - stuck at ai_parsing 10%
- Both workflows frozen, requiring manual restart

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Adaptive Timeout (File Size Based)** 🎯

**Before**: Fixed 60-second timeout for all files  
**After**: Dynamic timeout scaling with file size

```javascript
// Calculate adaptive timeout
const baseTimeout = 60000  // 60s base
const additionalTimeout = Math.min(
  Math.floor(fileContent.length / (100 * 1024)) * 10000,  // +10s per 100KB
  60000  // Cap at +60s (max 120s total)
)
const adaptiveTimeout = baseTimeout + additionalTimeout
```

**Examples**:
| File Size | Timeout | Logic |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| 50 KB | 60s | Base timeout |
| 100 KB | 70s | 60 + 10 |
| 200 KB | 80s | 60 + 20 |
| 500 KB | 110s | 60 + 50 |
| 1 MB+ | 120s | 60 + 60 (capped) |

---

### 2. **Auto-Retry on Timeout** 🔄

**Before**: Immediate failure, workflow marked as failed  
**After**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff

```javascript
// Retry logic
if (error.retryable && currentRetries < maxRetries) {
  const retryDelay = Math.pow(2, currentRetries) * 5000  // 5s, 10s, 20s
  
  // Update workflow to show retry
  await updateWorkflow({ 
    errorMessage: `Retrying after timeout (attempt ${currentRetries + 1}/2)` 
  })
  
  // Reschedule job with delay
  await addJob('ai-parsing', jobData, { delay: retryDelay })
  
  return { retrying: true }
}
```

**Retry Schedule**:
- **Attempt 1**: Immediate (original)
- **Attempt 2**: After 5s delay
- **Attempt 3**: After 10s delay
- **Failure**: Only after all 3 attempts exhausted

---

### 3. **Performance Metrics & Monitoring** 📊

**Before**: No visibility into API call performance  
**After**: Comprehensive timing and performance metrics

```javascript
// Metrics logged:
✅ Vision API response received in 15234ms (15.2s)
📊 Performance: 0.08MB @ 0.005MB/s
⚠️ Vision API took 85.3% of timeout budget - consider optimizing image

// On timeout:
⏱️ Vision API timeout metrics: 62145ms elapsed
```

**Metrics Captured**:
- Request start time
- Total duration (ms and seconds)
- Processing speed (MB/s)
- Timeout budget utilization
- Warning at >80% budget
- File size correlation

## 🔍 Verification & Testing

### ✅ **Test Results**

**Before Fix** (16:01 - 16:22):
```
wf_1760457694989_cmgqr22u - STUCK at ai_parsing 10%
wf_1760455082501_cmgqpi30 - STUCK at ai_parsing 10%
Status: Both frozen, 0 line items extracted
```

**After Fix** (16:32 - 16:35):
```
wf_1760457694989_cmgqr22u - ✅ COMPLETED at status_update 100%
wf_1760455082501_cmgqpi30 - ✅ COMPLETED at completed 100%
Status: Both processed, 2 line items extracted each
```

### 📊 **Recovery Timeline**

| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| 15:18 | Workflow 1 created, stuck at ai_parsing |
| 16:01 | Workflow 2 created, stuck at ai_parsing |
| 16:12 | Processor initialization fix deployed |
| 16:16 | Workflow 2 failed with timeout error |
| 16:22 | Workflows recovered to database_save 9% |
| **16:28** | **Vision API fix deployed** |
| 16:32 | Workflow 2 completed (status_update 100%) |
| 16:35 | Workflow 1 completed (completed 100%) |

## 📊 Monitoring Queries

### Check retry patterns:
```sql
SELECT 
  status,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  AVG((metadata->>'aiParsingRetries')::int) as avg_retries
FROM "WorkflowExecution"
WHERE current_stage = 'ai_parsing'
  AND metadata->>'aiParsingRetries' IS NOT NULL
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY status;
```

### Check timeout patterns:
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as timeout_count,
