## Design Direction
The design should feel premium and trustworthy like a financial app, with clean minimalism that makes complex data digestible - balancing Shopify's practical merchant focus with modern SaaS sophistication.

## Color Selection
Triadic color scheme using professional blues, warm oranges, and supporting grays to create trust while highlighting important actions and status indicators.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Blue (oklch(0.35 0.15 250)) - Conveys trust, stability, and professionalism for main actions
- **Secondary Colors**: Cool Gray (oklch(0.85 0.02 250)) - Clean backgrounds that don't compete with content
- **Accent Color**: Warm Orange (oklch(0.72 0.15 45)) - Draws attention to CTAs, warnings, and important status indicators  
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Background (Clean White oklch(0.98 0 0)): Dark Gray text (oklch(0.25 0.02 250)) - Ratio 12.1:1 ✓
  - Card (Pure White oklch(1 0 0)): Dark Gray text (oklch(0.25 0.02 250)) - Ratio 14.2:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Blue oklch(0.35 0.15 250)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 8.9:1 ✓
  - Secondary (Cool Gray oklch(0.85 0.02 250)): Dark text (oklch(0.25 0.02 250)) - Ratio 4.8:1 ✓
  - Accent (Warm Orange oklch(0.72 0.15 45)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 4.9:1 ✓

## Font Selection
Typography should feel modern and data-friendly, using Inter for its excellent legibility at small sizes and professional appearance in dashboard contexts.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (Page Titles): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter Semibold/24px/normal spacing  
  - H3 (Card Titles): Inter Medium/18px/normal spacing
  - Body (Data/Content): Inter Regular/14px/relaxed line height
  - Small (Labels/Meta): Inter Medium/12px/tight line height
  - Data Tables: Inter Tabular/14px for number alignment

## Animations
Subtle, purposeful animations that guide attention and provide feedback without feeling gimmicky - every motion should either orient users during navigation or confirm successful actions.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Smooth card entrances communicate data loading, hover states show interactivity, success animations confirm actions
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Primary actions get satisfying button press animations, secondary data updates use gentle fades, status changes use color transitions

## Component Selection
- **Components**: Card (dashboard layout), Button (primary actions), Table (PO data), Dialog (file upload), Badge (status indicators), Tabs (navigation), Progress (loading states)
- **Customizations**: Drag-and-drop upload zone, side-by-side diff viewer, confidence score indicators, interactive calendar scheduler
- **States**: Buttons show loading spinners, tables highlight on hover, forms validate inline with clear success/error feedback
- **Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons for actions (Upload, Calendar, Settings, Check, Warning) maintaining consistent visual weight
- **Spacing**: Consistent 4/8/16/24px spacing scale using Tailwind, generous whitespace around data-heavy sections
- **Mobile**: Responsive cards stack vertically, tables become scrollable cards, navigation collapses to hamburger menu at 768px breakpoint
