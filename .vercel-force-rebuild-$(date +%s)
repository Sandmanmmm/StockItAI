# FORCE VERCEL REBUILD - CACHE BUSTER

This file forces Vercel to ignore ALL caches and do a completely fresh build.

Timestamp: 2025-10-08T17:40:00Z
Build ID: FORCE_FRESH_BUILD_NO_CACHE_d66e45a
Reason: Prisma client still using old code with datasources override
Expected: New code without datasources override, using DIRECT_URL from schema

## Critical Changes That Must Be Applied:
1. api/src/lib/db.js line 22: Removed datasources.db.url override
2. Prisma should now use directUrl from schema.prisma
3. Should connect to port 6543 (pooler) NOT port 5432 (direct)

## Verification:
After deployment, logs should show:
- ✅ "PrismaClient created - using schema datasource config (pooler: port 6543)"
- ✅ Connection to aws-1-ca-central-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543

NOT:
- ❌ "Can't reach database server at db.omvdgqbmgxxutbjhnamf.supabase.co:5432"
