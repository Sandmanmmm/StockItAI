# Serverless Concurrency Fix - Prisma Engine Warmup

**Date:** 2025-10-09  
**Commit:** f0ca369  
**Status:** ‚úÖ DEPLOYED

## Problem Identified

When **multiple serverless functions** spin up simultaneously (e.g., cron job + file upload), each creates its own Prisma instance and they **race to warm up the engine**. This causes cascading "Engine is not yet connected" errors:

```
2025-10-09T20:50:50.186Z [warning] ‚ö†Ô∏è [RETRY] $queryRaw attempt 1/3 failed: Engine is not yet connected
2025-10-09T20:50:50.309Z [warning] ‚ö†Ô∏è [RETRY] $queryRaw attempt 2/3 failed: Engine is not yet connected
2025-10-09T20:50:50.510Z [error] ‚ùå [RETRY] $queryRaw failed after 3 attempts: Engine is not yet connected
```

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Serverless Cold Starts**: Each Vercel serverless function instance runs in isolation
2. **Concurrent Initialization**: Multiple functions starting at the same time each create their own Prisma client
3. **Insufficient Warmup**: 1.5 second warmup wasn't enough when under heavy concurrency
4. **Limited Retries**: 3 retry attempts with 100ms-2000ms backoff was too aggressive

### Why This Happens

```
Timeline:
T+0ms:    Cron job triggered ‚Üí Serverless Instance A spins up
T+10ms:   File upload received ‚Üí Serverless Instance B spins up
T+50ms:   Both instances create Prisma client and call $connect()
T+100ms:  Both instances enter 1500ms warmup delay
T+1600ms: Both instances try to query before engine is ready
T+1600ms: ‚ùå "Engine is not yet connected" errors start
```

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Increased Warmup Delay (db.js)

```javascript
// BEFORE
const warmupDelayMs = parseInt(process.env.PRISMA_WARMUP_MS || '1500', 10)

// AFTER
const warmupDelayMs = parseInt(process.env.PRISMA_WARMUP_MS || '2500', 10)
```

**Benefit**: Gives the Prisma engine more time to fully initialize on cold starts

### 2. Added Verification Retry Logic (db.js)

```javascript
// Verification with retry logic
let verified = false
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  try {
    await rawPrisma.$queryRaw`SELECT 1 as healthcheck`
    console.log(`‚úÖ Engine verified - ready for queries`)
    verified = true
    break
  } catch (error) {
    if (i < 2) {
      console.warn(`‚ö†Ô∏è Verification attempt ${i + 1}/3 failed, retrying in 500ms...`)
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500))
    } else {
      console.error(`‚ùå Engine verification failed after 3 attempts:`, error.message)
      throw error
    }
  }
}
```

**Benefit**: Doesn't consider Prisma "ready" until it successfully responds to a query

### 3. Increased Retry Attempts (prismaRetryWrapper.js)

```javascript
// BEFORE
maxRetries = 3,
initialDelayMs = 100,
maxDelayMs = 2000,

// AFTER
maxRetries = 5,
initialDelayMs = 200,
maxDelayMs = 3000,
```

**Benefit**: More resilient to transient connection issues with longer backoff

### Retry Progression

| Attempt | Delay (Before) | Delay (After) |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| 1       | 100ms          | 200ms         |
| 2       | 200ms          | 400ms         |
| 3       | 400ms          | 800ms         |
| 4       | ‚ùå Failed      | 1600ms        |
| 5       | ‚ùå Failed      | 3000ms (max)  |

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Successful Cold Start (Single Instance)
```
T+0ms:    Instance A: Creating PrismaClient
T+50ms:   Instance A: $connect() succeeded
T+2550ms: Instance A: Warmup complete (2500ms)
T+2550ms: Instance A: Verification attempt 1/3
T+2600ms: Instance A: ‚úÖ Engine verified - ready for queries
T+2600ms: Instance A: Returns connected Prisma client
```

### Concurrent Cold Starts (Multiple Instances)
```
T+0ms:    Instance A & B: Both creating PrismaClient
T+50ms:   Instance A & B: Both $connect() succeeded
T+2550ms: Instance A & B: Both warmup complete (2500ms)
T+2550ms: Instance A & B: Both verification attempt 1/3
T+2600ms: Instance A: ‚úÖ Verified (successful)
T+2600ms: Instance B: ‚ö†Ô∏è Verification failed, retry in 500ms
T+3100ms: Instance B: Verification attempt 2/3
T+3150ms: Instance B: ‚úÖ Verified (successful on retry)
```

## Monitoring Checklist

‚úÖ **No more "Engine is not yet connected" errors** after 3+ retry attempts  
‚úÖ **Warmup logs show 2500ms delay** instead of 1500ms  
‚úÖ **Verification attempts succeed** within 1-2 tries  
‚úÖ **Concurrent requests** (cron + upload) both succeed  
‚úÖ **Database queries execute** without cascading failures  

## Trade-offs

### Pros
- ‚úÖ Much more resilient to concurrent cold starts
- ‚úÖ Handles serverless concurrency gracefully
- ‚úÖ Reduces cascading failures
- ‚úÖ Better developer experience (fewer mysterious errors)

### Cons
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Adds ~1 second to cold start time (2.5s vs 1.5s warmup)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Slightly higher latency on first request after deploy
- ‚ö†Ô∏è More retry attempts = more log noise (but better success rate)

### Why This Is Acceptable
- Cold starts are **rare** (only after deploy or long idle periods)
- 1 second extra warmup is **negligible** compared to 30s timeout
- Success rate improvement **far outweighs** latency cost
- Warm instances (most requests) see **zero impact**

## Alternative Solutions Considered

### Option 1: Prisma Connection Pooling (Not Feasible)
- ‚ùå Vercel serverless doesn't support connection pooling across instances
- ‚ùå Each instance still needs its own Prisma client
- ‚úÖ Already using Supabase pooler (port 6543) for connection management

### Option 2: Pre-warm Prisma with Vercel Build Cache (Complex)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Would require custom Vercel build configuration
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited benefit (cache invalidated on deploys)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Doesn't help with concurrent cold starts

### Option 3: Reduce Concurrency (Not Practical)
- ‚ùå Can't prevent cron jobs and user uploads from coinciding
- ‚ùå Would require request queuing (adds complexity)

**Conclusion**: Increasing warmup delay + verification retries is the **simplest and most effective** solution.

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test concurrent uploads**: Upload multiple POs simultaneously
2. **Test cron + upload**: Trigger file upload right when cron job runs (every 5 minutes)
3. **Monitor cold starts**: Watch Vercel logs after deploys for warmup messages
4. **Check retry counts**: Verify most requests succeed on first or second attempt

## Files Modified

- `api/src/lib/db.js` - Increased warmup delay + added verification retry logic
- `api/src/lib/prismaRetryWrapper.js` - Increased retry attempts and backoff delays

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Monitor production logs for reduced "Engine not connected" errors
2. ‚úÖ Verify concurrent requests succeed
3. üîÑ Consider adding `PRISMA_WARMUP_MS` env var if further tuning needed
4. üîÑ Add metrics tracking for warmup times and retry counts
