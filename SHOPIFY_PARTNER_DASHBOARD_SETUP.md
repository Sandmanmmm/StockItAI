### If authentication still fails:
1. Make sure you're accessing through Shopify admin (not directly)
2. Clear browser cache and cookies
3. Reinstall the app on your development store
4. Check that all URLs in Partner Dashboard are correct

### If app doesn't load:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify all environment variables are set in Vercel
