## Fix #1: Prisma Connection Race Condition

**Commit:** 86e1698  
**File:** `api/src/lib/db.js` (lines 195-200)  
**Detailed Doc:** `PRISMA_CONNECTION_RACE_FIX.md`

### Problem
Concurrent serverless invocations getting stale global `prisma` client causing:
```
PrismaClientUnknownRequestError: Engine is not yet connected
```

### Root Cause
```javascript
// BUGGY CODE:
async function getClient() {
  if (!connectionPromise) {
    connectionPromise = initializePrisma()
  }
  await connectionPromise
  return prisma  // ❌ Returns stale global variable
}
```

**The Race:**
1. Request A: Creates `connectionPromise`, starts warming up
2. Request B: Sees existing `connectionPromise`, waits for it
3. Request A: Sets global `prisma` variable
4. Request B: Waits for same promise BUT gets stale global (not Request A's client)
5. Request B: Uses unconnected client → ERROR

### Solution
```javascript
// FIXED CODE:
async function getClient() {
  if (!connectionPromise) {
    connectionPromise = initializePrisma()
  }
  const freshClient = await connectionPromise  // ✅ Get fresh client from promise
  return freshClient || prisma  // ✅ Return fresh client, fallback to global
}
```

### Impact
- ✅ Workflows reach stage 1 reliably (AI parsing)
- ✅ No more "Engine is not yet connected" errors
- ✅ Concurrent requests handled correctly
- ✅ Cold starts work consistently

## Fix #2: PO Number Preservation During Conflict

**Commit:** f6e5c7b  
**File:** `api/src/lib/databasePersistenceService.js` (lines 251-277)  
**Detailed Doc:** `PO_NUMBER_PRESERVATION_FIX.md`

### Problem
PO conflict resolution deleted `poNumber` field, causing retry to create PO with `number: undefined`:
```javascript
// Workflow failed with:
PO Number: undefined  // ❌ Should be "114238498900"
Status: failed
Error: merchantId is not defined  // ❌ Misleading error (real issue was PO number)
```

### Root Cause
```javascript
// BUGGY CODE:
if (isUpdateOperation) {
  delete aiResult.extractedData.poNumber   // ❌ Deleted!
  delete aiResult.extractedData.number     // ❌ Deleted!
  continue  // Retry transaction
}

// Later in retry:
if (extractedData.poNumber || extractedData.number) {  // ← FALSE! Both deleted!
  updateData.number = ...  // ← NEVER EXECUTED
}
// Result: UPDATE succeeds with number: undefined
```

**The Bug Flow:**
1. AI extracts PO number: "114238498900"
2. Database UPDATE attempts: Set number = "114238498900"
3. PostgreSQL rejects: Unique constraint violation (duplicate)
4. Conflict handler: Deletes poNumber and number from extractedData
5. Retry executes: Condition false, updateData.number never set
6. UPDATE succeeds: PO has undefined number
7. Workflow continues: With corrupted data
8. Later stages fail: PO number required

### Solution
```javascript
// FIXED CODE:
if (isUpdateOperation) {
  // ✅ Fetch existing PO number from database
  const existingPo = await prisma.purchaseOrder.findUnique({
    where: { id: options.purchaseOrderId },
    select: { number: true }
  })
  
  if (existingPo && existingPo.number) {
    // ✅ Preserve existing number in extractedData
    aiResult.extractedData.poNumber = existingPo.number
    aiResult.extractedData.number = existingPo.number
    console.log(`✅ Will retry UPDATE with existing PO number: ${existingPo.number}`)
  }
  continue  // Retry with preserved number
}
```

### Impact
- ✅ PO conflict resolution works correctly
- ✅ PO number preserved during retry
- ✅ Stage 2 completes without hanging
- ✅ Workflow continues with correct data
- ✅ No more "undefined" PO numbers

## Fix #3: Cron Sequential Workflow Filtering

**Commit:** 2794255  
**File:** `api/process-workflows-cron.js` (lines 557-601)  
**Detailed Doc:** `CRON_SEQUENTIAL_WORKFLOW_FILTERING_FIX.md`

### Problem
Cron job skipping sequential workflows that had line items, preventing stages 3-6 from executing:
```
⏭️ Skipping workflow wf_xxx - PO abc has 2 line items (auto-fix will handle)
📋 Found 0 workflows to process
```

### Root Cause
```javascript
// BUGGY CODE:
const hasLineItems = po._count.lineItems > 0
if (hasLineItems) {
  // ❌ WRONG: Assumes "has line items" means "workflow complete"
  console.log(`⏭️ Skipping workflow - auto-fix will handle`)
  continue  // Skip workflow entirely
}
```

**The Flawed Logic:**
- Legacy workflows: Line items = complete (auto-fix handles) ✅ CORRECT
- Sequential workflows: Line items = stage 2 succeeded, stages 3-6 still needed ❌ WRONG

**The Bug Flow:**
1. Sequential workflow completes stage 2
2. PO created with line items ✅
3. Workflow status: 'pending' → 'processing'
4. Cron job runs: Finds "stuck" workflow (>5 min)
5. Checks line items: Found 2 line items
6. Applies legacy logic: "Has line items, skip it"
7. Stages 3-6: NEVER EXECUTED

### Solution
```javascript
// FIXED CODE:
// Check if this workflow is using sequential mode
let isSequential = process.env.SEQUENTIAL_WORKFLOW === '1'
if (!isSequential) {
  // Check per-merchant sequential setting
  const merchant = await fetchMerchantSettings(workflow)
  isSequential = merchant?.settings?.enableSequentialWorkflow === true
}

const hasLineItems = po._count.lineItems > 0

// ✅ Different logic for sequential vs legacy
if (hasLineItems && !isSequential) {
  // Legacy: Skip (auto-fix handles)
  console.log(`⏭️ Skipping workflow - auto-fix will handle`)
  continue
}

if (hasLineItems && isSequential) {
  // Sequential: Keep (needs stages 3-6)
  console.log(`✅ Keeping sequential workflow - needs to continue through stages 3-6`)
}

stuckWorkflows.push(workflow)  // Process it
```

### Impact
- ✅ Sequential workflows not skipped
- ✅ Stages 3-6 can now execute
- ✅ Legacy workflows still filtered correctly
- ✅ Test merchant workflows processed
- ✅ Complete end-to-end execution possible

## Why These Were Hard to Discover

### Issue #1 Masked Issue #2
- Prisma race prevented workflows from reaching stage 2
- PO number bug couldn't manifest until Prisma fixed
- Error: "Engine is not yet connected" (not "PO number undefined")

### Issue #2 Masked Issue #3
- PO number bug caused stage 2 to hang
- Workflows never completed stage 2 to create line items
- Cron filtering couldn't trigger without line items
- Error: Workflow timeout (not "workflow skipped")

### Issue #3 Was Silent
- No error logs (intentional skipping)
- Log message: "auto-fix will handle" (sounded reasonable)
- Workflow status: "processing" (not "failed")
- Only visible when cron job runs

### Discovery Required
1. **Log analysis**: Multiple serverless invocations, fragmented logs
2. **Database inspection**: Check workflow state, PO data
3. **Timing analysis**: 6-minute gap revealed hanging
4. **Code archaeology**: Trace execution through multiple files
5. **Root cause isolation**: Separate symptoms from causes

## Combined Impact

### Before All Fixes
```
Upload PO → Stage 1 Start
↓
Prisma connection race → ❌ FAILURE
"Engine is not yet connected"
Workflow: failed at stage 1
```

### After Fix #1 Only
```
Upload PO → Stage 1 Complete ✅ (10s)
↓
Stage 2 Start → PO conflict resolution
↓
PO number deleted → undefined number → ❌ FAILURE
Workflow: hangs 6 minutes, eventually fails
```

### After Fixes #1 + #2 Only
```
Upload PO → Stage 1 Complete ✅ (10s)
↓
Stage 2 Complete ✅ (3s, line items created)
↓
Workflow status: 'processing'
↓
Cron job runs → sees line items → skips workflow → ❌ ABANDONED
Stages 3-6: never executed
```

### After ALL THREE Fixes ✅
```
Upload PO → Stage 1 Complete ✅ (10s, AI parsing)
↓
Stage 2 Complete ✅ (3s, database save with line items)
↓
Stage 3 Execute ✅ (15-20s, product drafts)
↓
Stage 4 Execute ✅ (20-40s, image attachment)
↓
Stage 5 Execute ✅ (30-60s, Shopify sync)
↓
Stage 6 Complete ✅ (2-5s, status update)
Total: 80-138 seconds (1.3-2.3 minutes)
```

## Technical Lessons

### 1. Module Globals in Serverless
- **Problem:** Global variables can become stale across requests
- **Solution:** Always return values from promises, not globals
- **Principle:** Treat each request as isolated, even within same instance

### 2. Deleting Data Fields
- **Problem:** Deleting fields breaks downstream checks
- **Solution:** Fetch and preserve existing data before modification
- **Principle:** Never delete without replacement or explicit null handling

### 3. Feature Flags Need Holistic Integration
- **Problem:** New modes affect multiple code paths
- **Solution:** Check feature flags in ALL relevant filters/decisions
- **Principle:** Feature flags aren't just on/off switches, they change behavior everywhere

### 4. Error Messages Can Mislead
- **Problem:** "merchantId is not defined" wasn't the real issue
- **Solution:** Preserve original error context, don't replace with generic messages
- **Principle:** Surface root causes, not symptoms

### 5. Silent Failures Are Dangerous
- **Problem:** Workflow skipped without error
- **Solution:** Always log WHY decisions are made (skip, retry, continue)
- **Principle:** Make system behavior observable and debuggable
