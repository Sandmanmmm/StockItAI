# üî¥ CRITICAL: Connection Pool Size Needs Increase

## Issue Detected

**Date:** October 8, 2025 16:33:31 UTC  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Workflow failures under concurrent load

## Error Message

```
Timed out fetching a new connection from the connection pool. 
More info: http://pris.ly/d/connection-pool 
(Current connection pool timeout: 20, connection limit: 25)
```

## Root Cause

With **2-3 concurrent workflows** running simultaneously:
- Each workflow uses approximately **8-12 database connections** across stages
- First workflow completing STATUS_UPDATE (holding ~10 connections)
- Second workflow running AI_PARSING (holding ~8 connections)
- **Total: ~18 connections** in use
- Peak load can reach **25+ connections** with 3 concurrent workflows

**Current limit: 25 connections** - TOO LOW for production traffic

## Evidence from Production

### Timeline of Events (16:33:31)
1. **Workflow 1** completing STATUS_UPDATE stage (connection-heavy)
2. **Workflow 2** running AI_PARSING (connection-heavy)
3. **Workflow 2** tries to update PO status ‚Üí **Connection pool exhausted**
4. Error: `Timed out fetching a new connection`

### Connection Usage Pattern
- AI_PARSING: 5-8 connections
- DATABASE_SAVE: 8-12 connections (highest)
- DATA_NORMALIZATION: 3-5 connections
- MERCHANT_CONFIG: 2-4 connections
- AI_ENRICHMENT: 4-6 connections
- SHOPIFY_PAYLOAD: 2-4 connections
- SHOPIFY_SYNC: 3-5 connections
- STATUS_UPDATE: 6-10 connections

**Peak concurrent usage: ~25-30 connections** with 2-3 workflows

## Required Action

### URGENT: Update DATABASE_URL in Vercel

**Current connection string:**
```
postgresql://postgres.omvdgqbmgxxutbjhnamf:78eXTjEWiC1aXoOe@aws-1-ca-central-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres?pgbouncer=true&connection_limit=25&pool_timeout=20&connect_timeout=30
```

**New connection string (increase to 50):**
```
postgresql://postgres.omvdgqbmgxxutbjhnamf:78eXTjEWiC1aXoOe@aws-1-ca-central-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres?pgbouncer=true&connection_limit=50&pool_timeout=30&connect_timeout=30
```

### Changes Made:
1. `connection_limit=25` ‚Üí `connection_limit=50` (doubled for 4-6 concurrent workflows)
2. `pool_timeout=20` ‚Üí `pool_timeout=30` (increased by 50% for better resilience)

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Update Vercel Environment Variable

```bash
# In Vercel Dashboard:
# 1. Go to Project Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
# 2. Find DATABASE_URL variable
# 3. Update value to new connection string (above)
# 4. Click "Save"
# 5. Redeploy application (automatic after save)
```

### 2. Verify Supabase Pool Settings

Check Supabase dashboard:
- **Connection Pooler**: Enabled ‚úÖ
- **Pool Mode**: Transaction ‚úÖ
- **Max Connections**: Should allow 50+ (default is 100)

## Expected Results After Fix

### Before (25 connections):
- ‚ùå 2 concurrent workflows: Connection exhaustion
- ‚ùå 3 concurrent workflows: Guaranteed failures
- ‚ùå Peak load: System crashes

### After (50 connections):
- ‚úÖ 2 concurrent workflows: Comfortable headroom (~18/50 used)
- ‚úÖ 3 concurrent workflows: Still safe (~27/50 used)
- ‚úÖ 4 concurrent workflows: Within limits (~36/50 used)
- ‚úÖ Peak load (6 workflows): ~45/50 connections (safe margin)

## Why 50 Connections?

**Calculation:**
```
Average connections per workflow: 8-12
Target concurrent workflows: 4-6
Safety margin: 20%

Formula: (10 connections √ó 4 workflows) √ó 1.2 = 48
Rounded: 50 connections
```

This provides:
- ‚úÖ Headroom for 4-6 concurrent workflows
- ‚úÖ Safety margin for peak loads
- ‚úÖ Connection recovery time
- ‚úÖ No performance degradation

## Monitoring Recommendations

After implementing this fix, monitor:

1. **Connection Pool Usage**
   - Check Supabase dashboard for active connections
   - Should stay under 40-45 during normal operation
   - Spikes to 45-50 acceptable during peak loads

2. **Workflow Success Rate**
   - Should return to 95%+ after fix
   - No more "connection pool timeout" errors
   - Faster query execution (less contention)

3. **Query Performance**
   - Monitor slow query logs
   - Watch for connection acquisition time
   - Should be < 100ms consistently

## Alternative Solutions (If 50 Still Insufficient)

### Option 1: Increase to 75 Connections
For very high traffic (8-10 concurrent workflows):
```
connection_limit=75&pool_timeout=40
```

### Option 2: Enable Read Replicas
Distribute read queries across multiple database instances:
- Configure Supabase read replicas
- Update connection string for read/write separation
- Reduces load on primary connection pool

### Option 3: Implement Connection Caching
Add Redis-backed query caching:
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Reduce database queries by 30-40%
- Lowers connection pool pressure

## Status

- [x] Issue identified and documented
- [x] Solution defined (increase to 50 connections)
- [ ] **DATABASE_URL updated in Vercel** ‚Üê ACTION REQUIRED
- [ ] Vercel redeployed
- [ ] Fix verified in production
- [ ] Monitoring confirms resolution

## Risk Assessment

**Without this fix:**
- üî¥ HIGH: System will fail under concurrent load
- üî¥ HIGH: Customer workflows will fail randomly
- üî¥ MEDIUM: Data loss potential (failed transactions)
- üî¥ MEDIUM: Poor user experience (timeouts)

**With this fix:**
- üü¢ System handles 4-6 concurrent workflows safely
- üü¢ No connection pool exhaustion
- üü¢ Improved reliability and performance
- üü¢ Better user experience

## Priority

**CRITICAL - Implement ASAP**

Current system is **production-ready but fragile**. Works perfectly for 1-2 concurrent uploads but fails at 3+. For production traffic with multiple users, this fix is **essential**.
