# AI Refinement Pack Quantity Fix

## Problem
The AI refinement feature was including wholesale pack/case quantities in the refined product names and descriptions. For example:
- Original: "Case of 12 - Premium Coffee Beans"
- AI Output: "Premium Coffee Beans - Case of 12 Pack"
- Expected: "Premium Coffee Beans"

This was problematic because:
1. Customers purchase **individual products**, not entire cases/packs
2. Pack quantities should only be used for inventory management
3. Product names and descriptions should describe the single item being sold

## Root Cause
The AI generation endpoint (`/api/ai-generation/product-content`) was receiving the full wholesale product name including pack quantities and passing it directly to OpenAI GPT. The AI then included this information in the generated titles and descriptions.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Product Name Cleaning Function
Added `removePackQuantities()` helper function that strips out pack/case references:

```javascript
function removePackQuantities(productName) {
  // Removes patterns like:
  // - "Case of 12 - Product"
  // - "Product - Pack of 6"
  // - "12-Pack Product"
  // - "Product 24ct"
  // - "Product x6"
  
  let cleaned = productName.replace(/^(case|pack|box)\s+of\s+\d+\s*[-:•]\s*/i, '')
  cleaned = cleaned.replace(/\s*[-:•(]\s*(case|pack|box)\s+of\s+\d+\s*[)]?$/i, '')
  cleaned = cleaned.replace(/\b\d+\s*[-\s]*(pack|case|box|ct|count)\b/gi, '')
  cleaned = cleaned.replace(/\s+x?\d+\s*$/i, '')
  cleaned = cleaned.replace(/\s+/g, ' ').replace(/^\s*[-:•]\s*|\s*[-:•]\s*$/g, '').trim()
  
  return cleaned
}
```

### 2. Updated AI Prompts
Enhanced the GPT prompts with explicit instructions:

**Title Prompt:**
```
CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- IMPORTANT: Do NOT include pack/case quantities like "Case of 12", "Pack of 6", "12-Pack", "24ct", etc.
- This is for INDIVIDUAL product sales, not wholesale/bulk descriptions
- Customers buy individual items, not cases or packs
- Focus on the product itself, not packaging or bulk quantities
```

**Description Prompt:**
```
CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- IMPORTANT: Do NOT mention pack/case quantities like "Case of 12", "Pack of 6", "sold in packs", "comes in cases", etc.
- This is for INDIVIDUAL product sales, not wholesale/bulk descriptions
- Describe the SINGLE product that customers will receive
- Focus on the product's features, benefits, and use cases
- Do NOT reference bulk packaging, wholesale quantities, or multi-pack configurations
```

### 3. Applied to All Endpoints
Fixed both single and bulk generation endpoints:
- `/api/ai-generation/product-content` (single product)
- `/api/ai-generation/bulk-product-content` (multiple products)

## Files Modified
- `api/src/routes/aiGeneration.js`
  - Added `removePackQuantities()` helper function
  - Updated product name cleaning before AI processing
  - Enhanced AI prompts with pack quantity restrictions
  - Applied to both single and bulk endpoints

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Cases
1. **Leading Pack Quantity**: "Case of 12 - Premium Coffee Beans"
   - Expected: "Premium Coffee Beans"

2. **Trailing Pack Quantity**: "Premium Coffee Beans - Pack of 6"
   - Expected: "Premium Coffee Beans"

3. **Embedded Pack Quantity**: "12-Pack Premium Coffee Beans"
   - Expected: "Premium Coffee Beans"

4. **Count Suffix**: "Premium Coffee Beans 24ct"
   - Expected: "Premium Coffee Beans"

5. **Mixed Formats**: "Case of 12 - Premium Coffee Beans (6 Count)"
   - Expected: "Premium Coffee Beans"

### How to Test
1. Navigate to Quick Sync Pro interface
2. Click "View Details" on any product with pack quantities in the name
3. Click "Generate AI Content" button
4. Verify the refined title and description do NOT include pack/case references
5. Verify the refined content focuses on the individual product

## Benefits
✅ **Customer-Focused**: Product listings now describe what customers actually receive  
✅ **Accurate Descriptions**: No confusion about whether customers are buying bulk vs. individual items  
✅ **Better SEO**: Clean product titles without wholesale jargon  
✅ **Professional Appearance**: E-commerce standard product naming  
✅ **Inventory Separation**: Pack quantities remain in backend for inventory management

## Status
✅ **COMPLETE** - Ready for testing
