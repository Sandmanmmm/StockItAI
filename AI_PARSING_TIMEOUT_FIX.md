# AI Parsing Timeout Fix - Critical Production Issue

## üêõ Problem

PO `cmgntwpch0001lb04pxeau8t0` (PO-1760281084240) was stuck at **10% progress for over 5 minutes** in the `ai_parsing` stage.

### Symptoms
- PO status: `processing`
- Progress: 10% (stuck)
- Workflows: 2 active workflows, both stuck in `ai_parsing`
- Logs show: OpenAI API call started but never completed
- No error messages logged
- Cron re-queuing workflows as "stuck" but same issue repeats

### Timeline
```
10:58:04 - PO uploaded (3.8MB PDF, 5 pages)
10:58:10 - AI parsing started, PDF parsed successfully (9107 chars)
10:58:10 - OpenAI API call initiated
11:03:09 - Cron detected as "stuck" (>5min), re-queued
11:04:09 - New AI parsing attempt, same issue
11:07:09 - Still stuck at 10% progress
```

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### The Silent Killer

**Vercel Function Timeout vs OpenAI Client Timeout Mismatch**

```
Vercel Configuration (vercel.json):
  api/src/server.js: maxDuration: 30 seconds ‚ùå
  
OpenAI Client Configuration (enhancedAIService.js):
  timeout: 120000ms (120 seconds) ‚ùå
```

**What Happened:**
1. Bull queue worker started processing AI parsing job
2. OpenAI API call initiated with 120s timeout
3. **Vercel function hit 30s limit and killed the process**
4. OpenAI timeout (120s) never triggered because process was dead
5. No error was caught or logged
6. Bull job remained in "active" state indefinitely
7. Cron detected it as "stuck" and re-queued it
8. Cycle repeated endlessly

### Why It's Silent

The process dies **before** the OpenAI client can trigger its timeout and throw an error. The try-catch blocks in `_processWithOpenAI()` never execute because the process is forcefully terminated by Vercel.

### Why It Affects This PO

This specific PDF is likely:
- Large file size (3.8MB)
- Complex content (5 pages, 9107 characters)
- OpenAI API processing time > 30 seconds
- Falls into the "death zone" between 30s-120s

## ‚úÖ Solution

### Fix #1: Reduce OpenAI Timeout

**File:** `api/src/lib/enhancedAIService.js`

**Changed:**
```javascript
const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  timeout: 25000, // 25 second timeout (within Vercel's 30s limit)
  maxRetries: 2
})
```

**Rationale:**
- 25s timeout leaves 5s buffer for error handling
- Ensures timeout errors are caught before Vercel kills process
- Allows Bull job to fail properly and retry
- Error logs will show actual timeout errors

### Alternative Solutions Considered

#### Option A: Increase Vercel Function Timeout
```json
{
  "functions": {
    "api/src/server.js": {
      "maxDuration": 180  // Not feasible - costs money, still might not be enough
    }
  }
}
```
**Rejected:** Costs increase, doesn't solve root cause (large documents can take longer)

#### Option B: Background Processing with Webhooks
- Queue AI parsing to external service
- Webhook callback when complete
**Rejected:** Too complex, adds external dependency

#### Option C: Document Chunking
- Already implemented in `_processLargeDocument()`
- Kicks in for documents >12,000 characters
- This PDF is 9,107 characters (below threshold)
**Action:** Consider lowering threshold to 5,000 characters

## üìä Impact Analysis

### Before Fix
- **Silent failures**: No error logs, impossible to debug
- **Infinite loops**: Cron re-queues indefinitely
- **User confusion**: PO stuck at 10% with no feedback
- **Resource waste**: Multiple workflows processing same PO

### After Fix
- **Proper error handling**: Timeout errors logged clearly
- **Automatic retry**: Bull retries failed jobs (up to 3 attempts)
- **User feedback**: Error state triggers proper UI updates
- **Resource efficiency**: Failed jobs clean up properly

## üß™ Testing Plan

### Test Case 1: Large PDF Processing
1. Upload a 3-5MB PDF with 5+ pages
2. Monitor logs for timeout errors
3. Verify job fails gracefully after 25s
4. Confirm Bull retry mechanism activates
5. Check if chunking strategy is used on retry

### Test Case 2: Normal PDF Processing
1. Upload a 1MB PDF with 2-3 pages
2. Verify processing completes within 25s
3. Confirm no regression in normal workflows

### Test Case 3: Stuck PO Recovery
1. Check current stuck PO (cmgntwpch0001lb04pxeau8t0)
2. Wait for next cron cycle (1 minute)
3. Verify new error logs appear
4. Confirm PO status updates to `failed` or completes on retry

## üöÄ Deployment

**Commit:** `42c7bed` - "fix: reduce OpenAI timeout to prevent silent failures in Vercel"

**Deployed to:** Production (Vercel)

**ETA:** 5 minutes for deployment + warmup

## üìù Follow-up Actions

### Immediate (This Session)
- [ ] Monitor deployment logs for timeout errors
- [ ] Check if stuck PO recovers or fails gracefully
- [ ] Verify error messages are clear and actionable

### Short-term (Next Sprint)
- [ ] Lower document chunking threshold from 12k to 5k characters
- [ ] Add progress timeout detection (if progress unchanged for 2min, fail job)
- [ ] Implement exponential backoff for OpenAI retries
- [ ] Add telemetry for AI parsing duration metrics

### Long-term (Future)
- [ ] Consider streaming responses for large documents
- [ ] Implement progressive document processing (process as we parse)
- [ ] Add document complexity scoring to predict processing time
- [ ] Create dedicated worker pool for long-running AI tasks

## üéØ Success Metrics

- **No more silent failures**: All timeouts logged clearly
- **Recovery time <5min**: Stuck POs resolve within 5 cron cycles
- **User feedback**: Error states visible in UI
- **Retry success rate**: 60%+ of timeouts succeed on retry (chunking kicks in)
