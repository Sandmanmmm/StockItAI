## 💰 Cost Savings

| Metric | Before (API) | After (Scraping) | Savings |
|--------|-------------|------------------|---------|
| **Cost per query** | $0.005 | $0.00 | 100% |
| **Cost per PO** | $0.26 | $0.00 | 100% |

## 🎯 Deployment Steps

### 1. Restart API Server
```powershell
# Stop current server (if running)
# Press Ctrl+C in the terminal running the server

# Start server with new code
cd api
npm run dev
# OR
node src/server.js
```

### 2. Verify Server Started
Check logs for:
```
✅ Server started on port 3003
✅ Database connected
✅ Bull queues initialized
```

### 3. Test with Real PO Upload
Upload a test PO with 5-10 products:
```powershell
node test-upload-endpoint-integration.js
# OR upload via Shopify admin
```

### 4. Monitor Logs
Watch for these indicators:
```
🔍 LEVEL 2: Searching Google Images...
   🔎 Searching: "Brand Product Name"
      🔍 Extracted 10 unique image URLs from HTML
      ✅ Found 10 images via scraping
   ✅ Found 3 relevant product images
      📸 [Image URL] (confidence: XX%)
```

### 5. Verify Results
Check Shopify admin:
- ✅ Products created with images
- ✅ Image quality is high
- ✅ Images match products
- ✅ No errors in workflow

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: No images found
**Possible causes:**
- Google blocked requests (429 error)
- HTML structure changed
- Network issues

**Solutions:**
1. Check HTTP status codes in logs
2. Increase rate limiting delay (500ms → 1000ms)
3. Rotate user-agent strings
4. Add retry logic with exponential backoff

### Issue: Low confidence scores
**Possible causes:**
- URLs don't contain product keywords
- Brand not detected correctly

**Solutions:**
1. Review `extractBrand()` logic
2. Add more known brands to list
3. Adjust confidence calculation weights

### Issue: Wrong images
**Possible causes:**
- Query too generic
- Confidence calculation off

**Solutions:**
1. Verify query building logic
2. Review `buildImageSearchQueries()`
3. Check single query strategy is used

## 🚨 Rollback Plan

If web scraping fails or causes issues:

### Option 1: Re-enable Google API
1. Revert `searchGoogleProductImages()` to API version
2. Add back API key environment variables
3. Restart server

### Option 2: Disable Image Search
1. Comment out `searchGoogleProductImages()` call
2. Rely only on vendor images
3. Manual image addition by vendor

### Rollback File:
Keep a backup of the API version:
```javascript
// Old API version saved in git history
git show HEAD~1:api/src/lib/imageProcessingService.js > imageProcessingService.backup.js
```

---

## 📝 Environment Variables

### Required:
- ✅ No changes needed (removed API keys)

### Optional (for future enhancements):
```env
# User-Agent rotation (if needed)
GOOGLE_USER_AGENTS="Mozilla/5.0...,Mozilla/5.0...,..."

# Rate limiting configuration
GOOGLE_SCRAPING_DELAY_MS=500

# Enable/disable scraping
ENABLE_GOOGLE_SCRAPING=true
```
