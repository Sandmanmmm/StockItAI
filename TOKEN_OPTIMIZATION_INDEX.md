## 🎓 Key Concepts Explained

### What is Token Optimization?

Tokens are the units of text that AI models process. Every character, word, and space counts as tokens. Reducing tokens while maintaining or improving accuracy directly reduces costs.

**Example**:
```
Before: "Purchase Order Number: 12345" (6 tokens)
After:  "PO#12345" (2 tokens)
Savings: 67% reduction
```

### Why Does This Matter?

**Current state**:
- 8,500 tokens per document
- $0.0085 per document
- 10,000 documents/month = $85/month

**Optimized state**:
- 2,200 tokens per document (74% reduction)
- $0.0022 per document
- 10,000 documents/month = $22/month
- **Savings: $63/month = $756/year**

### How Does It Work?

1. **Text Preprocessing**: Remove noise before sending to AI
2. **Structured Output**: Enforce JSON schema instead of verbose prompts
3. **Intelligent Chunking**: Split large docs smartly, use micro-prompts
4. **Prompt Caching**: Reuse static prompt content across requests
5. **Two-Stage Processing**: Use cheap model first, expensive model only when needed
