# URGENT FIX: Auto-Fix Statement Timeout - Commit 982e200

## üö® Critical Problem Discovered

The auto-fix was **failing with statement timeout**:

```
Error: canceling statement due to statement timeout
PostgreSQL Error Code: 57014
Duration: >180 seconds
Connection: DIRECT_URL (port 5432)
```

### What Happened

Looking at the logs:
```
06:32:39 üîß Fixing stuck PO cmgna8jjx0001jm04qh4nfblg
06:32:39 Age: 1388s (23 minutes stuck)
...
06:34:39 ‚ùå Failed to fix PO: statement timeout (2 MINUTES LATER!)
```

The auto-fix took **2 full minutes** trying to update the PO, then PostgreSQL cancelled it!

## Root Cause

### The Lock Problem

The PO update was **waiting for a database lock** held by another connection:

1. **Active workflow job** - Still processing the PO
2. **Cron tried to update** - Waited for lock to be released
3. **180 seconds passed** - PostgreSQL `statement_timeout` fired
4. **Query cancelled** - Auto-fix failed, PO stays stuck

### Why It Happened

```javascript
// OLD CODE - Waits forever for lock
await prisma.purchaseOrder.update({
  where: { id: po.id },
  data: { status: 'completed', ... }
})
```

This uses a **blocking UPDATE** that waits indefinitely (up to `statement_timeout`).

## The Solution

### FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED

PostgreSQL has a special clause that **skips locked rows** instead of waiting:

```sql
UPDATE "PurchaseOrder"
SET status = 'completed', ...
WHERE id = ?
AND id IN (
  SELECT id FROM "PurchaseOrder" 
  WHERE id = ?
  FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED  -- ‚ö° The magic!
)
```

### How SKIP LOCKED Works

| Scenario | Old Behavior | New Behavior |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| PO unlocked | Update immediately ‚úÖ | Update immediately ‚úÖ |
| PO locked | Wait 180s, timeout ‚ùå | Skip immediately ‚è≠Ô∏è |
| Result | Auto-fix fails | Auto-fix continues to next PO |

### Implementation

```javascript
const updateResult = await prisma.$executeRaw`
  UPDATE "PurchaseOrder"
  SET ... 
  WHERE "id" = ${po.id}
  AND "id" IN (
    SELECT "id" FROM "PurchaseOrder" 
    WHERE "id" = ${po.id}
    FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
  )
`

if (updateResult === 0) {
  console.log(`‚è≠Ô∏è Skipped PO ${po.id} - locked (will retry next cron)`)
  continue // Move to next PO
}
```

## Benefits

### ‚úÖ No More Timeouts
- Cron completes in seconds, not minutes
- No more PostgreSQL query cancellations
- Fast failure instead of blocking wait

### ‚úÖ Graceful Degradation
- Locked POs are skipped, not failed
- Will retry on next cron run (1 minute later)
- Other POs in batch still get fixed

### ‚úÖ Better Logging
```
‚è≠Ô∏è Skipped PO cmgna8jjx0001jm04qh4nfblg - locked by another process (will retry next cron run)
```

Instead of:
```
‚ùå Failed to fix PO cmgna8jjx0001jm04qh4nfblg: statement timeout
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Scenario 1: PO Unlocked
```
06:35:39 üîß Fixing stuck PO cmgna8jjx0001jm04qh4nfblg
06:35:39 ‚úÖ Updated PO status to: review_needed
06:35:39 üìã Found 2 active workflow(s) to complete
06:35:39    ‚úÖ Completed workflow wf_...
06:35:39    ‚úÖ Completed workflow workflow_...
06:35:39 üéâ Auto-fix complete - Workflows completed: 2
```
**Duration**: <1 second ‚ö°

### Scenario 2: PO Locked
```
06:35:39 üîß Fixing stuck PO cmgna8jjx0001jm04qh4nfblg
06:35:39 ‚è≠Ô∏è Skipped PO - locked by another process (will retry next cron run)
06:35:39 üîß Fixing stuck PO cmgna8k9g0003jm04f0bfd1rm
06:35:39 ‚úÖ Updated PO cmgna8k9g0003jm04f0bfd1rm status to: completed
...
06:36:39 [Next cron run]
06:36:39 üîß Fixing stuck PO cmgna8jjx0001jm04qh4nfblg (retry)
06:36:39 ‚úÖ Updated PO status to: review_needed (lock released!)
```
**Duration**: <1 second per attempt, automatic retry ‚ö°

## Why PO Was Locked

Looking at your logs, there was **1 active database-save job** when the timeout occurred:

```
database-save: {
  waiting: 0,
  active: 1,  ‚¨ÖÔ∏è This job was holding the lock!
  completed: 0,
  failed: 3
}
```

That active job was likely:
1. Updating the same PO
2. Holding a row lock
3. Blocking the cron's auto-fix update
4. Eventually completed, releasing the lock

## Testing

After this deploy, watch for:

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators
```
‚è≠Ô∏è Skipped PO - locked by another process
‚úÖ Updated PO status to: review_needed
üéâ Auto-fix complete - Workflows completed: 2
‚è±Ô∏è Total cron execution time: <5000ms (not 124140ms!)
```

### ‚úÖ Queue Improvements
- database-save active: 1 ‚Üí 0 (after job completes)
- No more 2-minute timeouts
- Cron completes quickly

### ‚úÖ PO Eventually Fixed
- First attempt: Skipped (locked)
- Second attempt: Success (unlocked)
- Maximum delay: 1-2 minutes (next cron run)

## Related Fixes

This completes the **5th critical production fix**:

1. ‚úÖ **da324db**: Prisma engine cold-start (2.7s warmup)
2. ‚úÖ **2a4f369**: Transaction timeout 60s (handle lock contention)
3. ‚úÖ **2a6eea6**: Cron prismaOperation removal
4. ‚úÖ **f453f87**: Enhanced auto-fix (complete ALL workflows)
5. ‚úÖ **982e200**: SKIP LOCKED (prevent statement timeout) ‚¨ÖÔ∏è **THIS FIX**

## Summary

**Problem**: Auto-fix blocked for 2+ minutes waiting for database lock, then timed out  
**Solution**: Use `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` to skip locked rows instead of waiting  
**Impact**: Cron completes in <5 seconds, locked POs retried next run  
**Status**: Deployed to production (commit 982e200)

**Next cron run will show immediate improvement** - watch for skip messages and fast completion times! üöÄ
