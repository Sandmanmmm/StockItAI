# Fresh Workflow Test Guide

## Current System Status ‚úÖ

### Deployed Fixes (Commit acdbda7):
1. ‚úÖ Redis connection resilience with retry logic
2. ‚úÖ Shared Prisma client with retry wrapper
3. ‚úÖ Foreign key validation before creating sessions
4. ‚úÖ Line items persistence debugging logs
5. ‚úÖ Connection pool optimization

### Confirmed Working:
- ‚úÖ **Line items ARE persisting** - Database shows 2, 5, and 15 line items for recent POs
- ‚úÖ PDF parsing with pdf2json
- ‚úÖ AI processing with OpenAI
- ‚úÖ Database connections stable
- ‚úÖ No connection pool exhaustion

### What We're Testing:
üéØ **Complete 10-stage workflow progression:**
1. AI_PARSING ‚Üí 2. DATABASE_SAVE ‚Üí 3. DATA_NORMALIZATION ‚Üí 4. MERCHANT_CONFIG ‚Üí 
5. AI_ENRICHMENT ‚Üí 6. SHOPIFY_PAYLOAD ‚Üí 7. PRODUCT_DRAFT_CREATION ‚Üí 
8. IMAGE_ATTACHMENT ‚Üí 9. STATUS_UPDATE ‚Üí 10. COMPLETED

## How to Upload a Fresh Test PO

### Option 1: Via Shopify App (Recommended)
1. Open your Shopify store admin: https://orderflow-ai-test.myshopify.com/admin
2. Navigate to the StockIt AI app
3. Click "Upload Purchase Order"
4. Upload one of these test files:
   - `test-files/Grocery-Sample-Receipts-6a54382fcf73a5020837f5360ab5a57b.png`
   - `test-files/AI Refinery PO updated.pdf`
   - Any other test PO PDF

### Option 2: Via API Endpoint (If you have direct access)
```bash
curl -X POST https://stock-it-ai.vercel.app/api/upload/po-file \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "file=@path/to/test-po.pdf"
```

## What to Watch For

### 1. Workflow Monitor (Currently Running)
The monitor script is checking every 10 seconds and will show:
- ‚úÖ New workflow detection
- üîÑ Stage progression
- üì¶ Line items count
- ‚úÖ Success/failure status

### 2. Production Logs (https://vercel.com/dashboard)
Look for these key indicators:

**AI Parsing Stage:**
```
ü§ñ Starting AI parsing for workflow workflow_XXXXX
‚úÖ AI parsing completed successfully
```

**Database Save Stage (CRITICAL):**
```
üíæ Persisting AI results to database...
‚úÖ Line items created in transaction: Count: X, PO ID: xyz
‚úì Verification: X line items in transaction before commit
‚úÖ POST-COMMIT VERIFICATION: X line items found for PO xyz  ‚Üê KEY SUCCESS INDICATOR
```

**Data Normalization:**
```
üîß processDataNormalization - Starting normalization...
‚úÖ Data normalization completed
```

**Product Draft Creation:**
```
üé® Product Draft Creation data: purchaseOrderId: xyz
üîç DEBUG - Line items query result: X items found
üì¶ Creating product drafts for X line items
```

**Completion:**
```
‚úÖ Workflow completed successfully
Status: completed
All stages processed
```

---

## Expected Timeline

- **0-60s**: AI Parsing (OpenAI processing)
- **60-90s**: Database Save (with our debugging logs)
- **90-120s**: Data Normalization
- **120-150s**: Merchant Config + AI Enrichment
- **150-180s**: Shopify Payload + Product Drafts
- **180-210s**: Image Attachment + Status Update
- **Total: ~3-4 minutes for complete workflow**

---

## Success Criteria ‚úÖ

### Critical Success Indicators:
1. ‚úÖ **Line Items Persist**: POST-COMMIT VERIFICATION shows count > 0
2. ‚úÖ **All 10 Stages Execute**: Workflow progresses through all stages
3. ‚úÖ **Product Drafts Created**: Shopify products created successfully
4. ‚úÖ **PO Status = "completed"**: Not "failed" or stuck in "processing"
5. ‚úÖ **No Connection Errors**: No pool exhaustion or FK violations

### What We're Debugging:
- ‚ùì Why workflows show `currentStage: 'parsing_file'` instead of progressing
- ‚ùì Why PO status ends up "failed" even with persisted line items
- ‚ùì Whether the 10-stage refinement pipeline executes completely

## Current Monitor Status

**Running:** `monitor-workflow.js`
- Checks every 10 seconds
- Auto-detects new workflows
- Shows real-time progression
- Displays line items count

**Latest Workflow:** wf_1759908728730_cmgho7ts
- Status: completed
- Stage: parsing_file (‚ùå NOT progressing through all stages)
- Line Items: 2 (‚úÖ Persisted successfully)
- PO Status: failed (‚ùå Should be completed)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Upload a fresh PO** via Shopify app
2. **Watch the monitor** for new workflow detection
3. **Check Vercel logs** for detailed stage progression
4. **Look for POST-COMMIT VERIFICATION** in logs
5. **Verify all 10 stages execute** in sequence

**The monitor will automatically detect and track your new upload!**

## If Issues Occur

### Scenario 1: Line Items Not Persisting
Look for in logs:
```
‚ùå CRITICAL: Line items lost after commit! Created X, found 0
```
This would indicate transaction rollback or deletion issue.

### Scenario 2: Workflow Stalls at Stage
Check logs for:
```
‚ùå [STAGE_NAME] failed: Error: [message]
üí• PROCESSOR ERROR in [stage] job [id]
```

### Scenario 3: Connection Errors
With our new fix, you should see:
```
üîÑ [REDIS] Reconnecting on error: [message]
‚úÖ [REDIS] Client connected for [queue]
```
