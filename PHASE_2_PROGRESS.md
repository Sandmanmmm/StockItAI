# Phase 2 Deployment - Progress Report

**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Steps 1-3 Complete, Waiting for Test Workflow

---

## ✅ Completed Steps

### Step 1: Deploy to Production ✅
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Date**: October 14, 2025
- **Action**: Code deployed to Vercel production via Git push
- **Result**: Deployment successful, all merchants using legacy mode by default

### Step 2: Identify Test Merchant ✅
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Date**: October 15, 2025
- **Merchant Selected**: orderflow-ai-test.myshopify.com
- **Merchant ID**: `cmgfhmjrg0000js048bs9j2d0`
- **Success Rate**: 88.9% (24/27 workflows)
- **Recent Activity**: 27 workflows in last 30 days
- **Average Duration**: 223.5 minutes (legacy mode baseline)
- **Reasoning**: Active merchant with consistent upload pattern and high success rate

### Step 3: Enable Sequential Mode ✅
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Date**: October 15, 2025 02:49:11 UTC
- **Method**: Updated `merchant.settings` field with `enableSequentialWorkflow: true`
- **Verification**: Configuration verified in database
- **Scope**: Only this ONE merchant enabled, all others remain in legacy mode
- **Rollback Available**: `node disable-sequential-for-merchant.mjs cmgfhmjrg0000js048bs9j2d0`

## ⏳ Current Step

### Step 4: Monitor Test Workflow (IN PROGRESS)
- **Status**: WAITING FOR PO UPLOAD
- **Monitor Script**: Running in background
- **Started**: October 15, 2025 02:52:51 UTC
- **Timeout**: 15 minutes auto-timeout (can restart)
- **Watching For**: NEW workflows created after sequential mode enabled
- **Expected Merchant Behavior**: Based on history (27 workflows in 30 days), merchant should upload within hours/days

**Monitoring Details**:
- Script checks database every 5 seconds
- Will detect workflow immediately when merchant uploads
- Tracks real-time progress through stages
- Captures workflow ID for analysis
- Shows completion time vs baseline

**Performance Target**:
- ✅ **Success**: 3-5 minutes (45x faster than 223.5 min baseline)
- ⚠️ **Acceptable**: 5-10 minutes (22x faster)
- ❌ **Failure**: >30 minutes (needs investigation)

## 📋 Pending Steps

### Step 5: Analyze Test Results (PENDING)
- **Trigger**: After Step 4 workflow completes
- **Command**: `node analyze-test-workflow.mjs <WORKFLOW_ID>`
- **Analysis Includes**:
  - Performance metrics (duration, speedup factor)
  - Stage-by-stage timing breakdown
  - Comparison with legacy mode average
  - Data quality verification
  - Shopify sync confirmation
  - Recommendation (Proceed/Fix/Rollback)

### Step 6: Document Results (PENDING)
- **Trigger**: After Step 5 analysis complete
- **Deliverable**: `PHASE_2_TEST_RESULTS.md`
- **Content**:
  - Test details and metrics
  - Performance comparison
  - Issues discovered (if any)
  - Recommendation for Phase 3
  - Next action items

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Notes

### Per-Merchant Feature Flag
- **Storage**: `Merchant.settings` JSON field
- **Field**: `enableSequentialWorkflow: boolean`
- **Advantage**: No schema migration required
- **Scope**: Can enable/disable per merchant instantly
- **Migration Path**: Easy to move to dedicated table later if needed

### Database Schema Relations
- `WorkflowExecution` has `uploadId` and `purchaseOrderId` fields
- No direct `upload` or `purchaseOrder` relations in schema
- Monitor and analyze scripts updated to work with available fields
- Stage execution tracked via `WorkflowStageExecution` relation

### Scripts Fixed
1. `identify-test-merchant.mjs` - Changed import pattern, use status field ✅
2. `enable-sequential-for-merchant.mjs` - Use settings field instead of separate table ✅
3. `disable-sequential-for-merchant.mjs` - Updated to match enable script ✅
4. `monitor-test-merchant.mjs` - Removed upload relation, filter by creation time ✅
5. `analyze-test-workflow.mjs` - Removed missing relations, show stages ✅

## 🔄 Next Actions

### Immediate (Now)
1. ✅ Monitor script running in background
2. ⏳ Wait for merchant to upload PO
3. ⏳ Watch for "NEW WORKFLOW DETECTED" message

### After Workflow Detected
1. Monitor real-time progress
2. Note completion time
3. Copy workflow ID from output
4. Run analysis script
5. Document results

### If Success (3-5 minutes)
1. Document in PHASE_2_TEST_RESULTS.md
2. Mark Phase 2 as SUCCESS
3. Begin planning Phase 3 rollout (10% → 50% → 100%)

### If Issues (>10 minutes or errors)
1. Check Vercel logs for errors
2. Verify database records
3. Check Shopify sync status
4. Decide: Fix and re-test OR Rollback

## 🚨 Rollback Procedure

If critical issues discovered:

```powershell
# Immediate rollback
cd api
node disable-sequential-for-merchant.mjs cmgfhmjrg0000js048bs9j2d0

# Verify rollback
# Merchant will return to legacy mode (38 min workflows)
```

---

## 📞 Commands Reference

### Monitor Status
```powershell
# Check if monitor still running
cd api
node monitor-test-merchant.mjs cmgfhmjrg0000js048bs9j2d0
```

### Check Merchant Recent Activity
```powershell
# Re-run identification to see latest workflows
node identify-test-merchant.mjs
```

### Manual Workflow Check
```powershell
# Check database for new workflows
# (Add query script if needed)
```

---

## 💡 Notes

- **Merchant Activity**: Based on history, this merchant uploads regularly
- **No Manual Intervention**: Once merchant uploads, sequential mode will automatically engage
- **Zero Risk**: Only one merchant affected, instant rollback available
- **Production Logs**: Monitor Vercel logs for any unexpected behavior
- **Database Monitoring**: All workflows tracked in WorkflowExecution table
