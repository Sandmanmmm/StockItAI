# Vercel Deployment Cache Issue

**Date:** 2025-10-09  
**Issue:** Vercel still serving old code after push  

## Evidence

Latest commit shows 2500ms warmup:
```javascript
const warmupDelayMs = parseInt(process.env.PRISMA_WARMUP_MS || '2500', 10)
```

But production logs show:
```
2025-10-09T21:19:14.637Z [info] ‚è≥ Waiting 1500ms for engine warmup...
```

## Root Cause

Vercel is either:
1. **Still building** the new deployment (f0ca369)
2. **Using cached build** from previous deployment
3. **Multiple deployments active** (old instances not drained)

## Additional Problem: Engine Crashes

Seeing new error pattern:
```
Invalid `prisma.workflowExecution.findMany()` invocation:
Response from the Engine was empty
```

This indicates **Prisma engine crashing** under concurrent load, not just slow warmup.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Force Vercel Redeploy
```bash
# Trigger a manual redeploy in Vercel dashboard
# Or push a dummy commit to force rebuild
```

### Option 2: Set Environment Variable
Add to Vercel dashboard ‚Üí Environment Variables:
```
PRISMA_WARMUP_MS=3500
```

### Option 3: Reduce Connection Pool Size
Prisma might be overwhelming Supabase connection limits:
- Current: Default pool size (likely 10+ per instance)
- Multiple serverless instances √ó 10 connections = pool exhaustion
- Supabase free tier: 60 max connections

### Option 4: Use Prisma Accelerate (Recommended)
Prisma Accelerate provides:
- ‚úÖ Connection pooling across serverless functions
- ‚úÖ Query caching
- ‚úÖ No cold start issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Costs money ($29/month for production)

## Immediate Actions

1. ‚úÖ Check Vercel deployment status (might still be building)
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Add `PRISMA_WARMUP_MS=3500` environment variable as override
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Reduce Prisma connection pool size to 2-3 per instance
4. üîÑ Consider Prisma Accelerate for production

## Monitoring

Watch for:
- [ ] Logs showing `‚è≥ Waiting 2500ms` or `‚è≥ Waiting 3500ms`
- [ ] Fewer "Response from the Engine was empty" errors
- [ ] Verification retry logs (should see attempts)
- [ ] Overall error rate decrease

**Status:** Waiting for Vercel deployment to complete or need manual intervention
