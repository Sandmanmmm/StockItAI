# Test Upload Recommendation

Since we deployed the Prisma warmup fix (commit 5562890), here's what we should do:

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Successfully Completed
- **PO-1760425924869** (CSV): Completed with 2 line items
  - This was stuck for 40+ minutes
  - Completed right after the warmup fix deployed
  - **The fix is working!**

### ‚è≥ Still Running  
- **PO-1760427053254** (PNG, 79KB): Stuck at AI parsing for 18+ minutes
  - This is a Vision API call (image processing)
  - 79KB image can take 2-3 minutes with OpenAI Vision API
  - But 18 minutes is too long - likely stuck before the fix deployed

### üîß Stuck Jobs (Pre-Fix)
- Job 91: PNG file, started 12+ minutes ago (before warmup fix)
- Job 89: CSV file with OpenAI timeout error

## Recommendation

### Option 1: Wait for Current Jobs (5-10 minutes)
The PNG job (Job 91) will either:
- Complete successfully (Vision API finally responds)
- Hit the 200-second Vision API timeout and fail
- Get retried automatically by Bull

### Option 2: Upload a New Test File (Immediate)
To **verify the warmup fix works**, upload a fresh file:

1. Use the same test CSV (test-po-1758775860231.csv) or
2. Use a smaller PNG image (<20KB)

**Expected behavior with fix:**
```
Upload ‚Üí Job starts immediately
         ‚Üì
Fast path lookup (< 1 second) ‚ö°
         ‚Üì
Download file (2-5 seconds)
         ‚Üì
OpenAI API (30-60 seconds)
         ‚Üì
Database save (5-10 seconds)
         ‚Üì
Complete! (40-75 seconds total)
```

**Previous behavior (before fix):**
```
Upload ‚Üí Job starts
         ‚Üì
Wait for Prisma warmup (60 seconds!) ‚è≥
         ‚Üì
Download file (2-5 seconds)
         ‚Üì
OpenAI API (30-60 seconds)
         ‚Üì
Database save (5-10 seconds)
         ‚Üì
Complete (97-135 seconds total)
```

## What to Look For

### In Production Logs (Vercel)
```
‚úÖ GOOD (Fast Path Working):
‚ö° Fast path: Returning client during warmup (skipWarmupWait=true)
üìÅ File URL found: ...
üìÑ Downloaded file buffer, size: 175
ü§ñ Starting AI parsing...

‚ùå BAD (Still Waiting):
‚è≥ Engine warming up, waiting for warmup to complete...
... (long pause) ...
‚úÖ Engine warmup completed, proceeding with query
```

### In Frontend
```
‚úÖ GOOD:
- Upload ‚Üí "Processing" immediately (<5s)
- Progress updates start flowing within 10s
- Complete in 40-60s

‚ùå BAD:
- Upload ‚Üí "Waiting in queue" for 60s+
- No progress updates
- Takes 100-120s+ to complete
```

## My Recommendation

**Option 2: Upload a new small test file now**

Why:
- Immediately verifies the warmup fix works
- Don't need to wait for stuck jobs to clear
- Can see the performance improvement right away
- Build confidence that the issue is resolved

Test file suggestions:
1. **Small CSV** (fastest, ~30-40s total):
   ```csv
   SKU,Description,Quantity,Price
   TEST-001,Test Product,5,10.00
   TEST-002,Another Test,3,15.00
   ```

2. **Small PNG** (<20KB, ~45-60s total):
   - Simple receipt image
   - Screenshot of a PO
   - Not a huge 79KB grocery receipt

The old stuck jobs will eventually:
- Complete on their own
- Timeout and get marked as failed
- Get cleared by Bull's cleanup logic

But a new upload will prove the fix works **right now**.

## Expected Timeline

**New Upload with Fix:**
- 00:00s - Upload file
- 00:01s - Job starts (fast path!) ‚ö°
- 00:02s - File downloaded
- 00:35s - OpenAI parsing complete
- 00:40s - Database save complete
- 00:42s - Status update
- **Total: ~42 seconds** ‚úÖ

**Old Jobs (Pre-Fix):**
- Will continue running until they timeout or complete
- Can take 100-120+ seconds
- Not representative of the fix

---

**Bottom Line:** Upload a new test file to verify the warmup fix is working! The CSV that just completed is evidence it's working, but a fresh upload will confirm it for sure.
